# Implementation of Single-cell Genetic Perturbation Effect Prediction: Challenges and Beyond

### Course Project for IFT 6168 and IFT 6132, Winter 2024, at Mila and Université de Montréal.

### We find that a simple unconditional predictor is comparable with the state-of-the-art deep learning method on genetic perturbation effect prediction.

For installation, please follow the GEARS' repo: https://github.com/snap-stanford/GEARS.

To reproduce the experiments in the project, please set random seeds from 1 to 5.

### Note that similar empirical finding is also discussed in a recent paper (although I did not read it until I finished the project):
